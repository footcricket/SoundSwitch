![ClapSwitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93007427/215278272-492cc2d7-0e86-461e-8ca3-c74981624ace.jpg)

## Description 🔧

This project involves building a clap switch circuit that can control home appliances like lights and fans. The circuit is activated by clapping sound and can turn on or off the connected device based on the design of the circuit. The main components of the clap switch circuit are CD4017 IC, BC547 NPN transistors, DC condenser mic, capacitors, resistors, LED, and a power supply. The circuit operates by converting the sound energy of the clap into electrical energy through the condenser mic. The mic generates a small signal that triggers the CD4017 IC through a transistor. The IC then controls the connected device through a relay.

This project is an interesting hobby circuit that can be used to control various home appliances with just a clap sound. It is a simple and cost-effective solution for home automation.
