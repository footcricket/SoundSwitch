## Abstract
A circuit which operates through clap sound otherwise like that sound is called clap switch. This switch activates once or twice clapped & deactivates when again clapped once based on the design of the circuit. Clap switch is an interesting hobby circuit which turns on the lights with a clap sound. Condenser Mic basically converts sound energy into electrical energy, that in turns used to trigger IC 4017, through a Transistor. The fundamental concept of the clap switch is that the microphone used in this circuit receives the clap sound & generates a small signal to controls a lamp. This clap detector or clap activated switch can be used for home automation. Generally, this switch is operated through sound. For instance, light, fan, etc. can be controlled through clapping.

## Project Description
This is a homemade clap switch control circuit with a relay. Therefore, any home appliance can be controlled with this clap switch circuit. Clap switch circuit components list: -
1. CD4017 IC
2. BC547 NPN Transistors
3. DC Condenser Mic
4. 100nf (103) Capacitor
5. 10K Resistors
6. 270K Resistors
7. 1M Resistor
8. 220-ohm Resistors
9. LED
10. 5V DC Supply
11. Breadboard
This clap detector or clap activated switch can be used for home automation to control light/fan with the clap. This DIY clap switch is one of the most useful CD4017 application circuits.
